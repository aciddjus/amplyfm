# Amplyfm
Amplyfm is a open-source web app where you can enjoy unlimited free music, search for your favorite artists and genres or discover new ones, get song lyrics, watch your favorite music videos and share them with your friends.

For the data, such as artist biography, top tracks, similar artists, etc. it uses Last.fm API. For the lyrics, it uses lyrics.ovh API. And for streaming actual songs it uses YouTube data and iframe API

## Authentication
You'll need a Last.fm and YouTube API key for this to work. 

Lyrics.ovh API does not require any authentication.

## Getting API keys
Get the Last.fm API key [here](https://www.last.fm/api).

Get the YouTube API key through [google developer console](https://console.developers.google.com/).

Then edit them in `js/artist.js`
